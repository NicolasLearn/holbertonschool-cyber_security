## TASKS


### 0. Manual Discovery - Secrets in Plain Sight

    Your goal is to uncover a hidden flag by thoroughly exploring the site‚Äôs structure.

    Use all available discovery methods, including analyzing files such as robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and favicon.ico

        - Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x04
        - Target Endpoint: http://web0x04.hbtn/

    1 . Sitemap Exploration

        - Start by reviewing the sitemap located at /sitemap.xml. The sitemap may reveal unusual or hidden routes not linked from anywhere else on the site.
        - One of these routes contains your flag.

    2 . Additional Discovery

        - Investigate any common files such as robots.txt or favicon.ico, as they may contain further clues or hidden paths.

    Useful Instructions:

        1.Start by navigating to /robots.txt. Look for any Disallow entries that might hint at hidden or restricted paths. These paths could lead to interesting or hidden resources.
        2.Access /sitemap.xml. Sitemaps are used to help search engines index web content, but they may also reveal hidden resources. Find the resource that is not linked from anywhere else on the site to discover your flag.
        3.Download the site's favicon.ico and analyze it using tools or online resources like the OWASP favicon database. By matching the favicon to known frameworks, you might uncover more information about the site.
        4.Pay close attention to details in each file. Each file could contain direct paths or subtle hints that lead to the next step in your discovery process.
        5.Utilize online tools for favicon analysis and comparison to help identify the framework and speed up your search for hidden resources.

### 1. Manual Discovery - Headers, Headers, Always Check Headers

    HTTP Headers often hide secrets ü§´.
    In this task, you‚Äôll meticulously inspect HTTP response headers to unearth a hidden Flag ‚õ≥Ô∏è.
    This requires a keen eye and an understanding of how developers might conceal information within the HTTP protocol.

        - Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x04
        - Target Endpoint: http://web0x04.hbtn/

    Useful Instructions:

        1. Utilize `curl`, browser developer tools, or similar tools to examine the complete set of HTTP response headers returned from the target endpoint.
        2. Do not overlook non-standard headers; the flag may be tucked away within a custom or uncommon header field.
        3. Be aware that servers can dynamically alter headers based on the request's nature. Vary your request type, user-agent, and other headers to provoke different responses.
        4. Certain headers might appear only under specific circumstances (e.g., receiving error codes or when making requests with unique headers). Adjust your requests to explore these possibilities.

### 2. Manual Discovery - Stalking the Stack: A Template Tale

    Behind every sleek website lies a framework or template, often leaving subtle clues for a keen investigator.
    Your mission is to uncover the origin of the frontend template used by cod.hbtn.io To do this, you‚Äôll need to investigate its JavaScript source code and follow breadcrumbs to identify the vendor or framework behind it.

        - Target Website: https://cod.hbtn.io

    Your task is to submit the URL of the live preview of the frontend template used by cod.hbtn.io, as found on the vendor‚Äôs website.

        Example submission format:
            $ cat 2-vendor.txt
            https://vendorwebsite.com/template-name/
    
    Useful Instructions:
        1. Investigate the JavaScript files included or referenced by `cod.hbtn.io`. Look for comments, file names, or other clues that might indicate the template's origin.
        2. Pay attention to external libraries or frameworks linked within the source code, as these can often lead to template information.
        3. Vendor URLs or template names might be mentioned directly in the JavaScript code‚Äîkeep an eye out for URLs or references to third-party websites.
        4. Once you have a potential name or source, research it online to find the vendor's website, specifically searching for a live preview of the template in use.

### 3. Manual Discovery - Time Travelers: Unearthing the Past with OSINT

        6. fuzz: Undertakes basic fuzzing, pinpointing where a keyword (FUZZ) should be replaced.
        7. tftp: Brute-forces TFTP file names.

    This comprehensive feature set makes Gobuster adept at revealing the unseen parts of web applications and infrastructure.

    Your first mission is to familiarize yourself with Gobuster‚Äôs dir mode by conducting a directory brute-force attack against a target website.
    You‚Äôll leverage this mode to discover hidden directories that will return a Flag ‚õ≥Ô∏è as content with Task #4 as Website title.

        - Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x04
        - Target Website: http://web0x04.hbtn
    
    Useful Instructions:
        1. Select a wordlist for the directory brute-forcing operation. You can use common wordlists provided by tools like `dirb` or `SecLists`.
        2. Execute Gobuster in `dir` mode against the target website, specifying your chosen wordlist.
        3. Analyze the output, focusing on HTTP status codes that indicate the presence of a directory (e.g., 200 OK, 403 Forbidden).
        4. Document any interesting directories you discover, noting their paths and any content or functionality they reveal.

    Remember:
        - Experiment with different wordlists and options (e.g., specifying file extensions) to uncover as much as possible.
        - Be mindful of the network and server load you're generating with your requests to ensure responsible use of the tool.
    
    Hints:
        1- There are two layers to find, and both can be discovered simultaneously.
        2- The structure you're looking for is: web0x04//*.php.
        3- Multiple endpoints follow the same format, each ending with .php.
        4- Focus on fuzzing directories that lead to .php files‚Äîthey hide what you need!

### 5. The Buster Series - Unveiling Hidden Subdomains `dns mode`

    This powerful feature is designed for DNS subdomain enumeration,
    allowing you to uncover hidden or unlinked subdomains which could expose additional facets of the target‚Äôs online presence or infrastructure vulnerabilities.
    Unlock the secrets of DNS by performing a zone transfer to uncover hidden records.
    You‚Äôll use advanced DNS querying techniques to reveal alternative DNS records that may not be easily discoverable through standard methods.
    You‚Äôll leverage this mode to discover hidden subdomain that will return a Flag ‚õ≥Ô∏è as content with Task #5 as Website title.

        - Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x04
        - Target Domain: web0x04.hbtn
    
    Useful Instructions:
        1. Choose a wordlist tailored for DNS subdomain brute-forcing. The `SecLists` project offers comprehensive lists suited for this purpose.
        2. Use Gobuster in `dns` mode to enumerate subdomains for the target domain.
        3. Pay careful attention to the output, particularly any discovered subdomains. These entries can reveal development, staging, or other sensitive environments related to the target.
        4. Record the subdomains found, noting any that were previously unknown or particularly interesting in terms of security or functionality.
        5. Use the appropriate DNS query tools to attempt retrieving the DNS zone file for the target domain. Some DNS record types might contain hidden or valuable information.
        6. Once you‚Äôve performed the zone transfer, examine all returned records carefully. Look for any entries that seem out of the ordinary or contain unusual data.

    Remember:
    - Utilizing a high thread count with `-t` can speed up the scan but ensure it's within reasonable limits to avoid network or service disruption.
    - Some discovered subdomains may not be immediately accessible or resolve to public IP addresses, necessitating further investigation or different attack vectors.

    Hints:
        * DNS Query Tools: Make sure to use tools specifically designed for DNS queries. Some tools are capable of requesting entire zone files, which can contain valuable information.
        * Record Types: Don‚Äôt just look at the common records like `A` or `CNAME`. Pay special attention to `TXT` and `SOA` records, as these may contain more than just technical data.
        * Filtering the Results: Large zone files can be overwhelming. Use filtering methods to focus on records that contain descriptive information.
        * Understanding Zone Transfers: Look up how DNS zone transfers work and why certain records are included in a transfer. Some zones may have hidden content that is not immediately obvious.

### 6. FFuf Series - Subdomain Fuzzing Frenzy

        Useful Instructions:
            1. Constructing a fuzzing attack requires a precise location to be efficient.
            2. Create or select a wordlist tailored for fuzzing. Your wordlist should include common filenames, extensions, or parameters that could unveil hidden content.
            3. Execute Gobuster in `fuzz` mode, replacing the target URL's specific component `{¬∂}` with the keyword `FUZZ`.
            4. Analyze the responses for status codes or content lengths that stand out from the norm. These anomalies could indicate successful discovery of hidden content or functionality.
            5. Document any findings from your fuzzing efforts, highlighting how the discovered resources could impact the target's security posture or provide further avenues for exploration.

        Remember:
            - Fuzzing can generate a significant amount of traffic. Be mindful of the target server's capacity and any legal or ethical considerations.
            - The effectiveness of fuzzing is highly dependent on the quality and relevance of your wordlist. Customizing your wordlist for the target environment can greatly enhance your results.
            - Don't forget you are checking for two FUZZ

### 8. The Buster Series - Tackling TFTP with Brute Force `tftp mode`

    Your final challenge in the Gobuster series focuses on the tftp mode,
    a specialized approach aimed at brute-forcing filenames on servers using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP).
    TFTP servers are commonly used for booting network devices or for simple file transfers in environments where security is not a primary concern.
    However, misconfigured or unauthorized TFTP servers can expose sensitive information or system files to an attacker.
    You‚Äôll leverage this mode to find a file that contains a Flag ‚õ≥Ô∏è.

        - Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x04
        - Target Host: web0x04.hbtn

    Instructions:
        1. Given the nature of TFTP, compile a wordlist of common system configuration filenames, bootloader files, or backup file names that might exist on a TFTP server.
        2. Use Gobuster‚Äôs `tftp` mode to enumerate files on the target TFTP server.
        3. Be attentive to successful hits in Gobuster‚Äôs output, which can indicate the existence of a file on the server. Each found file warrants further analysis to understand its contents and implications.
        4. Compile a list of discovered files, offering insights into any potentially sensitive data or system information they might reveal.

    Remember:
        - TFTP does not support authentication by default, making it inherently insecure. Ensure that your testing is authorized and does not disrupt the target environment.
        - Brute-forcing a server can lead to network congestion or server performance issues. Conduct your tests responsibly and consider the impact on the target server and network.
